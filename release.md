## Easy script to push your release changelog on github

* Create a `release.md` as a template
* This script uses `release.md` file to push your changes to github releases
* It helps you tracking your project changelog on your `release.md` file
* You only need to generate a github token to get it working

[generate your token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)


_*just fill `publish.py` with your user, token and project variables and execute `python publish.py`_

**Do not push `publish.py` with your** _token_ **and** _user data_ **to a public remote as you will be exposing sensitive data, place it on `.gitignore` for security**
